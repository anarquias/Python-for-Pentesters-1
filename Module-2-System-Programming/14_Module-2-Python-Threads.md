#### Module 2: Python Threads

###### Global Interpreter Lock

- Apart from I/O Tasks such as Network reads, Writing to disk etc. Python Threads are not too useful.



###### Threads in Python- Simple threads using the thread module
- More complicated ones using the threading module

```sh
➜  Lesson-14 git:(master) ✗ cat thread.py
#!/usr/bin/env python

import thread
import time

def worker_thread(id) :

	print "Thread ID %d now alive"%id

	count = 1
	while True :
			print "Thread with ID %d has counter value %d"% (id,count)
			time.sleep(2)
			count += 1

for i in range(5) :
	thread.start_new_thread(worker_thread, (i,))

print "Main thread going for a infinite wait loop"
while True :
		pass                                                                              ➜  Lesson-14 git:(master) ✗
```

```sh
➜  Lesson-14 git:(master) ✗ python thread.py

Thread with ID 1 has counter value 1
Thread with ID 4 has counter value 1
Thread with ID 2 has counter value 1
Thread with ID 3 has counter value 1
Thread with ID 0 has counter value 1

Thread with ID 3 has counter value 2
Thread with ID 1 has counter value 2
Thread with ID 2 has counter value 2
Thread with ID 0 has counter value 2
Thread with ID 4 has counter value 2

Thread with ID 2 has counter value 3
Thread with ID 1 has counter value 3
Thread with ID 0 has counter value 3
Thread with ID 3 has counter value 3
Thread with ID 4 has counter value 3

Thread with ID 3 has counter value 4
Thread with ID 0 has counter value 4
Thread with ID 1 has counter value 4
Thread with ID 2 has counter value 4
Thread with ID 4 has counter value 4

Thread with ID 2 has counter value 5

###### Exercise

- Based on the knowledge you have gained in the network programming module, create a multi-threaded port scanner in Python which uses SYN Scanning
