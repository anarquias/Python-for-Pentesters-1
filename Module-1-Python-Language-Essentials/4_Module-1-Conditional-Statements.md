#### Module 1: Conditional Statements

###### if Statement

```sh
➜  Lesson-4 git:(master) ✗ cat if.py
#!/usr/bin/python

name = raw_input("what is your name?")

print "Your name is " + name

if name == "vivek":
	print "You are vivek"
	print "The computer admin"
elif name  == "john":
	print "You are John"
	print "A regular user"
else :
	print "Unknown user"
➜  Lesson-4 git:(master) ✗
```

```sh
➜  Lesson-4 git:(master) ✗ ./if.py
what is your name?vivek
Your name is vivek
You are vivek
The computer admin
➜  Lesson-4 git:(master) ✗ ./if.py
what is your name?john
Your name is john
You are John
A regular user
➜  Lesson-4 git:(master) ✗ ./if.py
what is your name?asd
Your name is asd
Unknown user
➜  Lesson-4 git:(master) ✗
```

###### while Loop

```sh
➜  Lesson-4 git:(master) ✗ cat while.py
#!/usr/bin/python

age = 20

while age > 10:

	age = int(raw_input("What is your age?"))

	if age > 10 :
		print "Your age is > 10"
	else :
		print "Your age is <= 10"
➜  Lesson-4 git:(master) ✗
```

```sh
➜  Lesson-4 git:(master) ✗ ./while.py
What is your age?12
Your age is > 10
What is your age?15
Your age is > 10
What is your age?8
Your age is <= 10
➜  Lesson-4 git:(master) ✗
```

```break``` - get out of innermost loop```continue``` - start the next pass of the innermost loop```pass``` - do nothing, placeholder

###### Exercise

- While loops can also have a "else" in Python
- Explore this functionality and write a simple program to illustrate

```sh
#!/usr/bin/python

age = int(raw_input("What is your age?"))

# While loop condition
while age > 20:
    print(age)
    break
else:
    print("Loop not entered")
```

```sh
➜  Lesson-4 git:(master) ✗ ./while_else.py
What is your age?45
45
➜  Lesson-4 git:(master) ✗ ./while_else.py
What is your age?1
Loop not entered
➜  Lesson-4 git:(master) ✗
```

###### for loop

```sh
>>> for item in [1,2,3]:
...     print item
...
1
2
3
>>>
```
```sh
>>> for item in ['a', 2, '3']:
...     print item
...
a
2
3
>>>
```

```sh
>>> names = ['vivek', 'john', 'andy', 'neo']
>>> names
['vivek', 'john', 'andy', 'neo']
>>> for name in names:
...     print name
...
vivek
john
andy
neo
>>>
```

```sh
>>> hybridList = [1, "vivek", 2, "neo", [1,2,3,5]]
>>> hybridList
[1, 'vivek', 2, 'neo', [1, 2, 3, 5]]
>>> for item in hybridList:
...     print item
...
1
vivek
2
neo
[1, 2, 3, 5]
>>>
```

```sh
>>> for (x,y) in [("vivek", 31), ("john", 25)]:
...     print (x,y)
...
('vivek', 31)
('john', 25)
>>>
```

###### Exercise

- For loops can have a “else” statement as well- Write a simple program to illustrate this functionality

```sh
>>> myNum = 9
>>> for myVar in range(15):
...     if myVar == myNum:
...             print 'Found !'
...             break
...     else:
...             continue
... else:
...     print 'Not found !'
...
Found !
>>>
```

```sh
>>> for item in [80,50,20]:
...     if (item > 50):
...             print item
...             break
...     else:
...             continue
... else:
...     print "No item found"
...
80
>>>
```

###### Emulating C style FOR loops

- C style loops
	
	```for (i=1; i<10; i++)```
	
```sh
>>> range(10)
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
>>>
```

```sh
>>> range(1,10)
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
>>>
```

```sh
>>> range(1,10,2)
[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
>>>
>>> for item in range(1,10,2):
...     print item
...
1
3
5
7
9
>>>
```
