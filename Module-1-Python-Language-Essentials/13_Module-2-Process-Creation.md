#### Module 2: Process Creation

###### Forking- Cloning of a process- Forking creates an identical process as the parent- The thread of execution is duplicated exactly at the point of call to ```fork()```	- returns ```0``` in the child	- returns ```PID``` of child in the parent- ```PID``` is different for parent / child

###### Use of fork()- Dedicate child to a task given by the parent- Parent and child can communicate if required using IPC- Parent / child binary remains the same

```sh
➜  Lesson-13 git:(master) ✗ cat fork-demo.py
import os

def child_process () :

	print "I am the child process and my PID is: %d"%os.getpid()

	print "The child is exiting"

def parent_process() :

	print "I am the parent process with PID : %d"%os.getpid()

	childpid = os.fork()

	if childpid == 0 :
		# we are inside the child
		child_process()
	else :
		# we are inside the parent process
		print "We are inside the parent process"
		print "Our child has the PID : %d"%childpid

	while True :
		pass

parent_process()
➜  Lesson-13 git:(master) ✗
```

```sh
➜  Lesson-13 git:(master) ✗ python fork-demo.py
I am the parent process with PID : 3687
I am the child process and my PID is: 3688
The child is exiting
We are inside the parent process
Our child has the PID : 3688
```

###### Spawning New Processes- ```os.exec*``` functions
	- ```os.execl```	- ```os.execle```- Overlays parent process with the child

```
os.execvp(file, args)
```

```sh
>>> import os
>>> >>> os.execvp("ping", ["ping", "127.0.0.1"])
